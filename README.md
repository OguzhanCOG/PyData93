- EnhanceFXâ„¢ V / VI (Model Card(s)): https://github.com/OguzhanCOG/EnhanceFX

## Codes / Models

I *can't* give EnhanceFX models*, **but** I have pushed an *excellent* HAT-based pretrained model to complement the ESRGAN one.

- The GUI I used live is 'chaiNNer': https://chainner.app/ | https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer

Been using chaiNNer since release, and I recommend it over many other utilities out there!

## Q&A Minutes

* This is why I couldn't reveal too much about the attention head, or quantum system.

Parameter size for dense connections & MoE-based is publically accessible for all! See GitHub page!
I have answered questions about SSIM/PSNR, dataset collection (Nomos8K), and downsampling too.
