## Codes / Models

I *can't* give EnhanceFX models, **but** I have pushed an *excellent* HAT-based pretrained model to complement the ESRGAN one.

- The GUI I used live is 'chaiNNer': https://chainner.app/ | https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer

Been using chaiNNer since release, and I recommend it over many other utilities out there!
