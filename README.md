- Great lesson by 3B1B on Attention (very simple): https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/attention

- Attention Is All You Need Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762

- Vision Transformer Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929

- ESRGAN Paper (CNN-based Super-Resolution): https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.00219

- Shifting Window (Swin) IR Paper (Transformer-based Super-Resolution): https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10257

- EnhanceFXâ„¢ V / VI (Model Card(s)): https://github.com/OguzhanCOG/EnhanceFX

## Codes / Models

I *can't* give EnhanceFX models (*), **but** I have pushed an *excellent* HAT-based pretrained model to complement the ESRGAN one.

- The GUI I used live is 'chaiNNer': https://chainner.app/ | https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer

Been using chaiNNer since release, and I recommend it over many other utilities out there!

## Slides

Find the slides in the root of this repo, or ask the PyData team!

## Q&A Minutes

(*) This is why I couldn't reveal too much about the attention head, or quantum system.

Parameter size for dense connections & MoE-based is publically accessible for all! See GitHub page!
I have answered questions about SSIM/PSNR, dataset collection (Nomos8K), and downsampling too.

## Feedback / Research / Opportunities

Ready to take on feedback, to do better next time. Alternatively, use my LinkTree Feedback Form. Much appreciated in advance.

**Always** down to chat with like-minded people, building awesome stuff. Sounds like you? Is your company in need? Drop me a line. Happy to help.
