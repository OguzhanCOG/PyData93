## Codes / Models

I can't give EnhanceFX models, but I have pushed an excellent HAT-based pretrained model to complement the ESRGAN one.

The GUI I used is 'chaiNNer': https://chainner.app/ | https://github.com/chaiNNer-org/chaiNNer

Been using chaiNNer since release, and I recommend it over many other utilities out there!
